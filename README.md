## Installation

### Using GitHub Releases

Download the appropriate version of `BeeClip` for your operating system and architecture on the [release page](https://github.com/penguingovernor/beeclip/releases).

Don't forget to add `BeeClip` to your operating system's PATH variable.

### Using Go

If you have the `go` binary installed on your system, you can get `BeeClip` by simply running `go install github.com/penguingovernor/beeclip`.

## Usage

To use `BeeClip` pipe the output of your command to it.

Example:

```bash
# Pipe the output of a command.
$ echo "Hello world!" | beeclip

# Copy contents of a file to clipboard.
$ beeclip < file.txt

# Or for multiple files.
$ cat file1.txt file2.txt | beeclip
```
